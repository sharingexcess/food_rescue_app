        <h2>Food safety is our priority</h2>
        <p>
          Our goal is to safely provide healthy food excess from our donors to
          hunger relief organizations in 30 minutes or less. Food safety

        <h2>Our 3 Golden Rules</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>Always be consistent and courteous to partners.</li>
          <li>Never eat or take any food donations.</li>
          <li>Only accept good quality food.</li>

        <h2>Food Temperature</h2>
        <p>
          The <b>“Danger Zone” </b> for bacterial growth on food is between 41*F
          and 129*F. Food is acceptable within this temperature range for 3 hrs.
          Afterwards, Sharing Excess can no longer accept it due to bacterial
          risk.
        </p>
        <p>
          Ensure all food donations were stored at the proper temperature to
          pickup:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>Frozen: 32*F and below</li>
          <li>Cold: 40*F and below</li>

        <h2>Perishables</h2>
        <p>

          As a general rule, only accept food that you would personally eat.
          Avoid making direct contact with food.
