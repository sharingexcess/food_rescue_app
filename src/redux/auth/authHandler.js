// This file is REDUX MIDDLEWARE. We use middleware to run async logic like login and logout.
// It's important to do this *outside* of the actual reducer logic,
// so that the reducers are always pure functions (no side effects).

// authHandler is a wrapper function, around a wrapper function, around a wrapper function.
// This seems super scary => it's not. Think of it as a function with 3 arguments.

// storeAPI: this is literally just the redux store object, plain and simple.
// next: this is the function call to the actual reducer itself.
// action: this is what was passed into the dispatch function call.
//         it'll have a 'type' field denoting which reducer to run,
//         and a 'payload' field with the actual data it wants to pass.

// We'll commonly call next(action) at the end of a handler function to pass the action on to the reducer.
